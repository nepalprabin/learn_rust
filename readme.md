# Learning Rust: A Journey Through The Rust Programming Language

This repository documents my journey through learning Rust, a modern systems programming language known for its safety, concurrency, and performance. Inspired by the resources provided in [The Rust Programming](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) Book, this repository serves as a personal log, a collection of code samples on each chapter.
